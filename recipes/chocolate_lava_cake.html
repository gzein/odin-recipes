                the buttered ramekin with granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Combine the chocolate and 3 tbspn butter in a heat-safe bowl 
                set over a pan of simmering water. Alternatively, microwave 
                in 30s blasts.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine 3 tbspn sugar, egg, egg yolk, vanilla 
                and salt. Whisk vigorously until mix is thick, foamy and pale, 
                about 2 mins. Whisk in the flour until smooth.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, add the chocolate to the egg mix and stir 
                gently until all combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the mix into the ramekin. bake for 12-14 mins or until the 
                eges are set and puffed, but the center is still soft when lightly 
                pressed.</li>
            <li>Use an offset spatula or small knife to loosen the edges of the 
                cake from the ramekin. Place a plate over the ramekin and carefully 
                invert the warm cake. Use an oven mitt or clean kitchen towl to 
                remove the ramekin, dust the cake with confectioner's sugar and 
                serve with ice cream or whipped cream.</li>
